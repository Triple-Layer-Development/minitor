implement a method of converting our intro_encrypt key into an ed25519 key, look in src/ext/ed25519/donna/ed25519_tor.c for the tor implementation and read https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2014/000205.html
for a plaintext explaination. Additionally determine if the descriptor signing key is the main key or the extension key for the intro descriptor certs, look at
src/feature/hs/hs_service.c and find out which key is the signing key and which is the main key
